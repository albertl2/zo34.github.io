      <description>Great things that happened this year.  I got to see family for almost an entire month. I did well in Spring, Summer, and Fall sessions of school. I learned that it is ok to feel bad, alone, sick. I (re)learned that God does His work even when I don&amp;rsquo;t feel or see anything. I worked a couple of interesting jobs (barista, vehicle lift maint./installer). I changed my degree path to computer science!</description>
