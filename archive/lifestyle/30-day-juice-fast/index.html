    <h1 class="post-title">Juicing for 30 Days</h1>
    <p class="post-meta">May 12, 2015</p>
  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I first watched “Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead” almost two years ago. Since then I’ve been rather struck by the idea of juicing. Money and time were limiting factors up to this point. Now, though, I’ve come in to a considerable amount of spare time and I thought I’d give juicing a go.</p>

<p>What spurred my renewed interest in juicing was a movie I found on Amazon Prime or something similar called “Super Juice Me”. I understand the film is a giant commercial for Jason Vale’s facility in South America, but several things stuck out to me.</p>

<p>First was the occurance of sleep apnea in two of the male participants in the experiment. One was morbidly obese and the other not so much. Both reported that the symptoms of apnea disappeared over the period of the experiment. This interests me because I suffer from both kinds of sleep apnea and would really, really like a good night’s sleep. So, part of why I’m juicing is to hopefully reduce the symptoms of my apnea.</p>

<p>Second, I noticed that several individuals with rosacea or similar skin conditions markedly improved over the thirty days of Vale’s experiment. Given that I am flushed all the time and the majority of my skin is on the rough side (like I’m allergic to something) I figured juicing may have some affect.</p>

<p>Also, I’m quite a bit overweight and it turns out juicing is quite good at weight loss. But before I begin I need to answer some questions.</p>

<h2 id="questions-i-need-to-answer-before-i-start">Questions I need to answer before I start:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>How much should I drink?</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>“For “meal times” (breakfast, lunch and dinner), it is very normal to drink about 17-27 oz (approx. 500ml to 800ml) each time in place of a solid food meal…”</p>

      <p>– <cite>Sarah Ding<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></cite></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The Mean Green by Joe (from rebootwithjoe.com) makes just about 32 fluid ounces of juice<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. The FAQ on Joe’s site mentions that each meal should come in about 16 to 20 ounces, though<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>I’ll be sticking to about 32 ounces per meal for the duration of my juicing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What should I drink?</p>

    <p>These first two questions rely heavily upon each other. A decision in one case will directly impact the other.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How long should this go on for?</p>

    <p>Quite a few websites recommend about 30 days<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote">4</a></sup><sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote">5</a></sup>, some recommend more or less, and none of these are what could be considered reputable (scientific) sources. I guess I’ll stick with thirty days here at the start because that seems to be what most people do.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What should I expect when/if…?</p>

    <p>This is a huge, super-general question. Therefore I will struggle mightily to fill in the blank with all of the possible possibilities (instead of refining the question).</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>…I get X number of days in?</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>It seems like a lot of people have a rough time about three to five days into a juice fast. This will be something I need to plan for. (sources here)</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>…I start throwing up after I drink the juice?</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This isn’t a purposeful reference to Jim Jones. Apparently a lot of people who juice are allergic to various greens. This manifests itself more (apparently) when said individuals consume the juices of those greens. Celery seems to be a prime culprit in this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What should I not juice?</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Jalepenos<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">6</a></sup></li>
      <li>Mustard greens<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">7</a></sup></li>
      <li>Five beets at once<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">8</a></sup>, instead start with half a beet as they assist in detoxing the liver<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">9</a></sup> (supporting study?)</li>
      <li>Onions<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">10</a></sup></li>
      <li>Pomegranite with seeds<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote">11</a></sup></li>
      <li>Lime peel<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote">12</a></sup></li>
      <li>Pickle<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote">13</a></sup></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What <em>should</em> I try juicing?</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Kale, watercress, cucumber<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">14</a></sup></li>
      <li>Beet and watercress<sup id="fnref:4:1"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">14</a></sup></li>
      <li>1/8 of an onion, tomato, celery, parsley, lime<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">15</a></sup></li>
      <li>Sweet potato and pineapple<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote">16</a></sup></li>
      <li>Fava bean greens and agretti<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote">17</a></sup></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="references">References</h2>
<p>Why, yes! These are all anecdotal! And! And a lot of them are from Reddit! I did notice that! Calm down, anecdotes are about all I need in this oh-so-unscientific quest for better sleep, less apnea, and maybe more energy. I can’t afford an all out scientific inquisition. I would go that route if I could afford it.</p>
